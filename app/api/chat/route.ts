Professional Contributions at EmendoAI: Pioneering GenAI EvaluationHarsh Kumar Banka's current professional engagement at Emendo is centered on the critical and rapidly evolving field of Generative AI evaluation frameworks. This work addresses the significant challenges associated with deploying robust, reliable, and user-centric GenAI applications in real-world scenarios.His contributions are particularly impactful in tackling the "messy, multi-turn nature of human-AI collaboration," moving beyond simplistic, single-turn benchmarks that often fail to capture real-world complexities.2 The core of the evaluation framework he is involved with allows for the decomposition of real-world tasks into interdependent subtasks. This granular approach enables precise tracking of both Large Language Model (LLM) performance and the nuances of user interaction patterns throughout a conversation.2Furthermore, Harsh has contributed to or utilized a sophisticated suite of novel metrics designed to assess GenAI performance comprehensively. These include a composite usage metric derived from semantic similarity, word overlap, and numerical matches; structural coherence; intra-turn diversity; and a unique measure of the "information frontier," which reflects the alignment between AI outputs and users' existing knowledge and evolving understanding.2 The application of this methodology has been demonstrated in a practical "financial valuation task," underscoring his ability to translate theoretical frameworks into tangible, problem-solving solutions.2 Empirical findings from this work have revealed valuable insights, such as how greater integration of LLM-generated content generally enhances output quality, but its benefits are moderated by factors like response incoherence, excessive subtask diversity, and the distance of provided information from users' existing knowledge.2 This demonstrates a nuanced understanding of AI system limitations and the intricacies of human-AI interaction.Harsh's specific contributions align directly with Emendo's broader strategic approach to Generative AI. His work is instrumental in moving beyond basic prompt-based demonstrations, specifically addressing critical deployment roadblocks such as "accurate model evaluation, query complexity management, and human-AI collaboration".3 Emendo's emphasis on developing "metrics that actually align with how your users judge qualityâ€”metrics that capture accuracy, relevance, and business context" 3 showcases a strong user-centric and business-oriented approach to AI development, a highly valued trait in any engineer.This experience positions Harsh at the forefront of AI operationalization, responsible AI development, and the practical application of AI in production environments. The successful deployment and adoption of GenAI applications in real-world business contexts are heavily dependent on robust and meaningful evaluation. Many organizations are currently grappling with how to effectively measure the performance and utility of LLMs beyond basic benchmarks. Harsh is directly contributing to solving this complex, high-stakes problem, which is pivotal for the maturation of the GenAI industry. This experience demonstrates not only technical proficiency in AI but also a deep understanding of the challenges associated with deploying AI solutions, the paramount importance of user experience, and the ability to contribute to foundational frameworks that enable scalable and responsible AI adoption. This makes him a highly valuable asset for roles where understanding AI evaluation and its real-world impact is paramount.The work on Generative AI evaluation frameworks that Harsh is involved in is also notable for its presentation on arXiv 2, a prominent repository for scientific pre-prints. The act of preparing and publishing a paper on arXiv, even as a pre-print, signifies that the work is considered a formal research contribution. It implies that the methodology is rigorous, the findings are clearly articulated, and the work adheres to scientific standards of inquiry and presentation. This suggests that Harsh possesses strong research skills, including the ability to formulate complex problems, design empirical studies (as evidenced by the "empirical findings" mentioned), analyze data, and effectively communicate scientific and technical results. This indicates he is capable of contributing to the academic and industrial discourse in his field. This demonstrated research capability is highly appealing for roles that involve R&D, innovation, or require a candidate to stay at the cutting edge of technology and contribute to thought leadership. It also suggests a proactive individual who takes the initiative to formalize and disseminate their contributions, which is a sign of intellectual curiosity and a commitment to advancing the field.4.
